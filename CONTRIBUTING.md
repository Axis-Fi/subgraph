# Development Workflow

## Branch Naming Convention

Use [semantic branch names](https://gist.github.com/seunggabi/87f8c722d35cd07deb3f649d45a31082) that describe the type of change:

- feat/feature-name - New features
- fix/bug-description - Bug fixes
- chore/task-description - Maintenance tasks
  Example: `fix/user-balance-race-condition`

## Commit Messages

Use [semantic commit messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716):

```
<type>: <description>
```

Examples:

```
fix: avoid race condition fetching users and balances
feat: add new staking interface
chore: update dependency versions
```

## Code Consistency

- Use lowercase camelCase for folders and filenames (e.g. `userProfile`)

## Deployment Flow

Run `NETWORK=<chain> pnpm deploy:graph` (e.g. `NETWORK=base-sepolia pnpm deploy:graph`)
